This project is the creation of an API simulating banking operations. Built using Spring Boot, it performs all CRUD
operations. In addition to storing all transactions in a bank, it creates a history of transactions when a deposit,
withdrawal or transfer is made between registered accounts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- `controller`: Controller for managing accounts.
- `dto`: Responsible for encapsulating and transferring data between different parts of an application, facilitating
  communication and maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
- `entity`: Represent a business object or concept within the application domain, encapsulating its attributes and
  behaviour, often mapped to a database table, and providing methods for data manipulation and interaction.
- `exception`: Represent exceptional conditions or errors that occur during the execution of a program, providing
  information about the error and facilitating error handling and propagation through the application.
- `mapper`: Maps an AccountDto object to an Account object.
- `repository`: Provide an abstraction layer for accessing and managing data storage.
- `service`: Encapsulate business logic and orchestrate the execution of various operations within the application.

## Main Classes and Interfaces

1. `BankingAppApplication`: Main class to bootstrap the Banking Application.
2. `AccountRepository`: This interface extends JpaRepository to provide basic CRUD operations for Account entities.
3. `TransactionRepository`: This interface extends JpaRepository to provide basic CRUD operations for Transaction
   entities.

## Getting Started

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Compile the project using the provided build script or your IDE's build tools.
4. Run the main class to start.
5. Along with the files, there is a json named 'api_bank.postman_collection.json' that can be used to perform operations
   on the DB, just export it in Postman.
